Styrmir is a god of weather, but like many gods, has their own small place to call their ownâ€“ an island they keep much like a chia pet. 
You've just been appointed as their aide for this incarnation. Can you keep the island alive?

(Tip: Appointing a priest will allow them to give you tips and tricks.)
